Calculator is a 1v1 bot that focused on ball-control. It is a *finite state machine*, which means it has various states and transitions between them based on the situation. It attempts to catch the ball if it's falling, pick it up if it's rolling, and tries to dribble it into the opponent's goal. It even has a signature move: when dribbling, it can [pop the ball up and over charging defenders.](https://clips.twitch.tv/LitigiousTacitBearPeanutButterJellyTime "Twitch clip")

## HiveExampleBot

HiveExampleBot showcases my *hivemind* code for RLBot. It allows you to control multiple bots with one process. This means that you can coordinate movements with ease. This code has been adapted into [RLBotChoreography](https://github.com/tarehart/RLBotChoreography "GitHub link").

## HiveBot

[Insert GIF Here]

HiveBot is my work-in-progress *hivemind* bot. My goal with this bot is to show what you can really do with bots when they all cooperate.

## Retired

I built multiple bots before I arrived at HiveBot and Calculator. This folder is full of old or test bots. I can't guarantee good documentation or even working code. Maybe you'll find something useful, but you've been warned.

## Test

TestBot is a bot for gathering info about the game's physics or testing functions. This folder also includes miscellaneous code for pathing.
