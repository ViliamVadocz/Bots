# RLBot

Custom Bots for Rocket League.

My RLBot history so far:

- I started working on RLBot in January of 2019.
- I created BoostHog, a bot which just tries to collect boost. That was my introduction - my 'Hello World' - to the RLBot Framework. 
- In the community discord I heard of an upcoming tournament, Wintertide, and decided to quickly put together a bot to try and qualify. I managed to just make the cut, only to lose in the first match :(. 
- After the tournament, I tried to remake Calculator, now without having to rush to meet a deadline. Unfortunately, this period did not last long, because I had to take a break from programming to focus on my International A Levels. 
- I returned to RLBot in July of 2019 with a renewed sense of purpose. I decided to start a new bot, based on an idea which started all the way back when I started programming bots: I wanted to make a hivemind. That is exactly what HiveBot is. It controls multiple agents *intelligently* using only one process. 
- I also participated in a Speedbots tournament in late July of 2019 in which I needed to make a bot in 3 hours. I used my hivemind framework and I made some good progress, but due to bad task prioritisation the bot ended up just being an ATBA and it lost all its matches :(.
- I continues working on HiveBot. I created HiveExampleBot to make my hivemind framework easily sharable.
- League Play began and I decided to try making a quick 1v1 bot again. I revived Calculator and remade it into a dribble bot using what I learned from HiveBot. It has been quite successful so far.
- I hosted the Space Jam Microgravity Tournament in late September for which I made a custom game rule mutator.
- Currently, I continue working on my main bots: HiveBot and Calculator.
