# RLBot

Custom Bots for Rocket League.

## Calculator

[Insert GIF Here]

Calculator is a 1v1 bot that focused on ball-control. It is a finite state machine, which means it has various states and transitions between them based on the situation. It attempts to catch the ball if it's falling, pick it up if it's rolling, and tries to dribble it into the opponent's goal. It has a signature move where, when dribbling, it can [pop the ball up and over charging defenders.](https://clips.twitch.tv/LitigiousTacitBearPeanutButterJellyTime)

## HiveExampleBot

HiveExampleBot showcases my hivemind code for RLBot. It allows you to control multiple bots with one process. This means that you can coordinate movements with ease. This code has been adapted into [RLBotChoreography](https://github.com/tarehart/RLBotChoreography)

## HiveBot

HiveBot is my work-in-progress hivemind bot. My goal with this bot is to show what you can really do with bots when they all cooperate.

## Retired

Of course, I built multiple bots before I arrived at HiveBot and Calculator. This folder is full of old or test bots. Don't expect good documentation or even working code here. Maybe you'll find something useful, but you've been warned.

## Test

TestBot for gathering info about the game's physics or testing functions. Also includes miscellaneous code for pathing.
