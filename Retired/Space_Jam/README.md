# Space Jam Zero Gravity Mutator

Space Jam was a microgravity tournament I hosted. The document can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fwlE7MBHgIVXEGurIeF1gGjKyDe9iHFHGYKA6z1HUkc/edit?usp=sharing) and the VOD can be found [here](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/484846590).

This is the mutator used. It set the gravity to zero and also teleports the ball to [0, 0, 700] on kickoffs. There is a `STICK` parameter which determines the amount that cars stick to walls/ceiling/floor.
